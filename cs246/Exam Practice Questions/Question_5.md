## Iterators
In this question, you are writing a template binary tree class Bintree<T> where T is name of a type.
a) Write the definition of the class, with data members (the data, left child and right child) and the big 5.
    
b) Change your class definition so that the pImpl idiom is followed.

c) Write an iterator `class Bintree<T>::Iterator` with in-order traversal and the as- sociated method `Bintree<T>::begin()` and `Bintree<T>::end()`. 

How should you change your solution so that pre-order and post-order traversals are also implemented?
